<p>Students across different sections of the same course are assigned  different texts.  Some students are assigned free OER resources as their text, and others are assigned overpriced  texts from predatory publishers.  After 2 weeks the professors take a random anonymous poll of their classes to see how many students have managed to begun the assigned readings in their respective texts.  The results are as follows:</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Sample Frequency} \amp \text{Has Done Reading} \amp \text{Has Not Yet Done Reading} \\
\hline
\text{OER} \amp 66 \amp 14 \\
\hline
\text{Predatory Publisher} \amp 112 \amp 58 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">One professor claims that this constitutes a clear difference between the type of resource assigned to students and whether or not they can complete their assigned tasks.  Their colleague dismisses it and says any difference is purely due to random chance, and the type of material has no impact on student accesibility, in other words these things are independent.</p>
