<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">So, this isn't fantastic.  Turns out there is a real difference in the efficacy of these two medications, but it's simply to small for our study to reliably detect.  The researchers may not know that this difference in the medication exists, but they're certainly aware that something like this could be an issue.</p>
<p>The problem fundamentally is that the standard error \(SE\) is simply to large, and the test is thus insensitive to this difference.  Since</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
SE=\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n}+\frac{s_2^2}{n}}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">we could shrink the standard error by increasing \(n\) and taking a larger sample.  But we can't just keep testing bigger and bigger groups, there are time and financial limitations.  Also the researchers don't know there is a difference to be found, and don't want their time looking for a difference that doesn't exist.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Sec_SizeofSampleNum.html#remark-58">in-context</a></span>
