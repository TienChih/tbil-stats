<p>Our newly elected city councilperson is spearheading an initiative to attract more restaurant to open in her city.  She hopes to convince potential investors that the 1 year closure rate in this town is less than the national average of 60%.  She randomly samples 50 restaurant that were  opened at least a year ago and 25 of them closed in the first year.</p>
