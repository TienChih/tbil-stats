<p>Suppose that a group of students wanted to investigate anxiety levels of their fellow students regarding academic success.  They decide to interview their colleagues, but because of the size of the school, interviewing every student is not feasible.  Consider the following ways in which they could find a sample of students to interview.  Which would be good ways to select a sample?  What are some advantages or disadvantages of each method.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>Randomly select a group of students from the school roster to interview.</li>
<li>Interview students coming to the tutoring center.</li>
<li>Interview students in Math classes.</li>
<li>Select a random group of seniors to interview.</li>
<li>Randomly select a a random group of Freshman, a random group of Sophmores, a random group of Juniors and a random group of Seniors to interview.</li>
