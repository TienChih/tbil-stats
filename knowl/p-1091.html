<p>A watchdog group concerned about gender discrimination at a company randomly polls 528 of the company's employees, 312  men and 216  women.  At the end of last year of those surveyed, 102 employees recieved raises: 72 men and 30 women.  The watchdog group points out that the proportion of men who got raises is significantly greater than the proportion of women who got raises and suggests this is due to inequitable practices within the company.  The company claims that any difference between the rates and men and women getting raises is purely by random chance.</p>
