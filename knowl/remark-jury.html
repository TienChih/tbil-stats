<p>In a jury trial, we always presume that the defendant is innocent until proven guilty.  The default state is not guilty unless the evidence is sufficient to change this verdict.</p>
<p>Similarly, in a hypothesis test, the <em class="emphasis">Null Hypothesis</em> (<span class="process-math">\(H_0\)</span>)is analagous to the default claim of not guilty.  It is the claim that any presented evidence is just the product of random chance.  The <em class="emphasis">Alternative Hypothesis</em> (<span class="process-math">\(H_A\)</span>) is analagous to the guilty verdict, in which case the evidence provided is sufficiently strong to reject the <em class="emphasis">Null</em>.</p>
<p>Note that in a jury trial, the veridcts are “guilty” and “not guilty”.  Innocence is not the goal of the defense, since it is the burden of the state to present evidence sufficiently strong to invalidate a not-guilty claim.  It is <em class="emphasis">not</em> their responsibility to prove innocence.</p>
<p>Similarly, accepting the Null Hypothesis in a hypothesis test <em class="emphasis">is not the same as saying the Null Hypothesis is true</em>.  It merely means that the evidence provided is not strong enough to convincingly say otherwise.  The Null Hypothesis could very well be false, but your evidence is too weak to say so.  As a Statistics practioner, your job is to analyze the evidence and see if it is strong enough to invalidate the Null.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Sec_HypothesisTesing.html#remark-jury" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
