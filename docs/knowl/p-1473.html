<p>The difference between these variables is <em class="emphasis">itself</em> a random variable, with a population mean <span class="process-math">\(\mu_{d}\)</span> and population standard deviation <span class="process-math">\(\sigma_{d}\text{.}\)</span>  We can then perform any one variable numerical inference exactly as in we were in <a href="Sec_OneVarNum.html" class="internal" title="Section 6.2: Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing for a single Numerical Variable (N2)">SectionÂ 6.2</a>.  We just have to properly interpret what statements about the difference mean:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>A C% <em class="emphasis">confidence interval</em> for <span class="process-math">\(\mu_d\)</span> is an interval that has a C% chance of containing the average difference between our two populations.</p></li>
<li><p>The null hypothesis <span class="process-math">\(\mu_d=\mu_0\)</span> is the assumption that the average difference between the two populations could be <span class="process-math">\(\mu_0\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>The alternative hypothesis <span class="process-math">\(\mu_d\lt \mu_0\)</span> is the claim that the average difference between the two populations is less than <span class="process-math">\(\mu_0\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>The alternative hypothesis <span class="process-math">\(\mu_d&gt; \mu_0\)</span> is the claim that the average difference between the two populations is greater than <span class="process-math">\(\mu_0\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>The alternative hypothesis <span class="process-math">\(\mu_d\neq \mu_0\)</span> is the claim that the average difference between the two populations is different from <span class="process-math">\(\mu_0\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
