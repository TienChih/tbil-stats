<p>The problem fundamentally is that the standard error <span class="process-math">\(SE\)</span> is simply to large, and the test is thus insensitive to this difference.  Since</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
SE=\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n}+\frac{s_2^2}{n}}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">we could shrink the standard error by increasing <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> and taking a larger sample.  But we can't just keep testing bigger and bigger groups, there are time and financial limitations.  Also the researchers don't know there is a difference to be found, and don't want their time looking for a difference that doesn't exist.</p>
