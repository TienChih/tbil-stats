<p>Suppose that the proportion of American adults who support the expansion of solar energy were 88%.  If we sampled 1000 random American's, we wouldn't neccesarily expect exactly 88% of them to support Solar Energy would we?  Maybe we would get a group of 1000 that had more support for solar, or less.  How much variability can we expect?</p>
