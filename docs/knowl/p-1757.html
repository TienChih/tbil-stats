<p>We won't go through the details of this computation or it's derivation.  The main take away is <span class="process-math">\(\left(\frac{x_i-\bar{x}}{s_x}\right), \left(\frac{y_i-\bar{y}}{s_y}\right)\)</span> measures the distance of the data points from their mean, scaled by the deviation.  If <span class="process-math">\(x_i\)</span> is above (or below)<span class="process-math">\(\bar{x}\)</span> whenever <span class="process-math">\(y_i\)</span> is above (or below) <span class="process-math">\(\bar{y}\text{,}\)</span> then these terms are positive and the sum is large and positive.  If one is above whenever the other is below, these terms are negative and the sum is large and negative.  If it's a mix, then the positive and negative terms cancel and you are close to 0.</p>
