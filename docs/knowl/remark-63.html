<p>The details of the <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> distribution are extremely technical.  This is what you should take away:  <span class="process-math">\(F=\frac{MSG}{MSE}\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(MSG\)</span> measure the variability between groups and <span class="process-math">\(MSE\)</span> measure the variability within groups.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>If  <span class="process-math">\(MSE\)</span> is big compared to <span class="process-math">\(MSG\)</span> then there is a lot of variability within groups.  This variability easily explains the variability between the groups.  Thus <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is small,  and the tail, and thus <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>-value, is big.  We fail to reject the null because the variability within groups plausibly explains our data.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, if <span class="process-math">\(MSG\)</span> is big compared to <span class="process-math">\(MSE\text{,}\)</span> then there is a lot of variability between groups.  More than the natural variation can explain.  There is likely some <em class="emphasis">actual</em> differences between the groups.  In these cases, <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is big, the tails are small and so are the <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>-values.  We reject the null (when <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>-value <span class="process-math">\(\lt 0.05\)</span>) when it's no longer plausible that natural variation within groups can explain our data.</p></li>
