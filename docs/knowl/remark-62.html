</h4>
<p>The null hypothesis of ANOVA testing is that all of the groups have identical distributions, and the alternative is that they do not.  <em class="emphasis">If</em> the null hypothesis were true, then it must follow that all the variation between the groups is driven by the natual variation of the variable itself.</p>
<p>So what we will do is compare the variation <em class="emphasis">between</em> groups, and variation <em class="emphasis">within</em> groups.  If the null hypothesis holds, them we would expect that these values are comparable.  If there is some discrepency, then we become more suspicious of the null.  As usual, this level of suspicion will be measured with a <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>-value, which measure the probability that: should the null be true that we see the levels of discrepency or greter than what's observed.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Sec_ANOVA.html#remark-62" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
