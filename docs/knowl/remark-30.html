<p>The 95% confidence interval is a range of values, so that the actual proportion of heads has a 95% chance of being in the interval.  Since 0.5 is in this interval, we can't rule out the probability that the coin really is fair.</p>
<p>Note that we <em class="emphasis">have not proven the coin is fair</em>.  After all, there are many values in this interval other than 0.5  There's also the 5% chance that the proportion of heads this coin will show is outside of this interval, which is small, but not 0.</p>
<p>But the evidence certainly isn't strong enough to rule out that the coin is fair.  So we accept the coin may be fair.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Sec_HypothesisTesing.html#remark-30" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
