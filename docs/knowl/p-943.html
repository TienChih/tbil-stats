<p>Your friend has a point in this case: heads has come up quite a few times, more than half for sure, and they may be right to suspect that the coin may favor heads.  On the other hand, it's possible to get 16 coin flips out of 25 just by chance.  But is this a common event, or an event so rare that it's more likely the coin is biased?</p>
