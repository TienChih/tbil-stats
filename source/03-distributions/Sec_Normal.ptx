      <p>
        In this section, we study one of the most ubiquitous and fundamental probability distributions in nature and mathematics: the <term>normal distribution</term>.  We may know this as the standard <q>bell curve</q>.

    <title>The Standard Normal Curve</title>

    <definition>
      <p>
        The <term>standard normal curve</term> is the curve generated by <me>y=\frac{e^{-x^2/2}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}.</me>
        This may be seen below.

       <title>Shape of the Normal Curve</title>

           <p>We observe some things about the shape of the normal curve.</p>

          Where is the peak of this curve?

        <p>
          How would you compare the behavior of the curve as <m>x</m> is positive, compared to negative?

      <task>
        <p>
          What happens to the hight of the curve as <m>x</m> moves away from 0?
        </p>

      <task>
        <p>
          Where is the bulk of the area under the curve?
