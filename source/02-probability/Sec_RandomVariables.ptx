    <statement>
      <p>
        In <xref ref="Sec_Center"/>, and <xref ref="Sec_Variation"/> we found how to find the mean, variance and a standard deviation of a finite population.  Then previously in this chapter, we studied the probability of individual events either happening or not happening.  In this section, we look at the collection of outcomes of random process, and measure centrality and spread of these processes.

      <introduction>
          <p>Two books are assigned for a statistics class: a textbook and its corresponding study guide. The
university bookstore determined 20% of enrolled students do not buy either book, 55% buy the
textbook only, and 25% buy both books, and these percentages are relatively constant from one
term to another.</p>

          If there are 100 students enrolled, how many books should the bookstore expect
to sell to this class?

         The textbook costs $137 and the study guide $33. How much revenue should the bookstore expect
from this class of 100 students?

  <definition xml:id="definition-expectedvalue">
    <p>
      Given a random variable <m>X</m>, the <em>expected value</em> of <m>X</m> denoted <m>E(X)</m> is the mean outcome of <m>X</m>.

    <p>
      For a random variable <m>X</m> with a finite number of ouctomes <m>X_1, \ldots, X_n</m> the expectation of <m>X</m> is computed <me>E(X)=\sum P(X=X_i)\cdot X_i.</me>
